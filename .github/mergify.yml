          Hey @{{ author }}, this pull request failed to merge and has been
          dequeued from the merge train. If you believe your PR failed in
          the merge train because of a flaky test, requeue it by commenting
          with `@mergifyio requeue`.
          More details can be found on the `Queue: Embarked in merge train`
          check-run.
